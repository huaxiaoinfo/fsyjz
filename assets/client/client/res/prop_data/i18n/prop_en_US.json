In addition, it is recommended to wait until the enhancement reaches level 30 before considering clearing.; The specific attributes that can be attached are as follows:; Sun Moon Star Enhancement Additional Attributes:; Physical attack technique skill=100000; Speed=4000; The speed bonus of the physical attack technique is 0.1 to 1.5; The speed percentage of physical attack technique is between 9% and 15%; The attributes that can be attached to the enhancement of Chen Yin Yang:; Physical and legal defense=50000 yuan; Life=600000; Physical Attack Method Skill Bonus=0.1 to 1.5 Life Bonus=0.4 to 2; The percentage of physical attack skill is between 9% and 15%; Life=11% to 25%; Attention: The attribute bonus refers to the halo bonus, and the percentage bonus refers to the immortal gate bonus.; Q: Why does my ranking on the competitive ladder leaderboard remain unchanged at night?; A: Rankings such as Competitive Ladder, World Ladder, etc. have a daily deadline of 9 pm when rewards are settled. The challenge ranking remains unchanged beyond the time limit.; Q: Why didn't I see it when Zhou Ka said there was a super sweep?; A: The super sweep condition is that all six levels in this chapter are three-star. And only when the physical strength is sufficient to scan all the levels in this chapter and complete all the times will it be displayed. You can check carefully.; Q: Why didn't I see it when I filled up the human level weekly card and said there was super chaos control?; A: Because the person level weekly card does not increase the number of times you have dealt with chaos. If you have only dealt with one super chaos before, it will not be displayed.; Q: Why is the normal life of my hero only a few tens of millions to complete levels?; A: There are no halo runes or other bonuses in the level.; Q: What can be obtained from the copy of Fengshen Jiuyi?; A: A large amount of spirit stones, qi, divine cultivation pills, rare star soul treasure chests, rare equipment fragments, and other props for cultivating rare heroes.",

    "万仙阵大战说明": "Wanshan Array Battle Explanation:\nRegistration and Participation:\nWanshan Array starts every Saturday from 9:50 PM to 11:00 PM. The first 10 minutes are preparation time with no combat, no scoring points, no items to pick up, and no Six Soul Flags. It officially starts at 10:00 PM. Participation requires joining a sect, and a team must be arranged by the sect master or deputy sect master. Without a team, entry is not allowed.\n1. About the battlefield map:\n1.1 The battlefield is a 99 by 99 square map with no obstacles.\n1.2 The four corners are four fierce beast altars, with the center being the Tongtian Altar, and there are other less important altars.\n1.3 Players enter the battlefield at a random coordinate point.\n1.4 The map will shrink over time, called shrinking circles, with five possible scenarios: shrinking towards the four corners or towards the central Tongtian Altar.\n1.5 There are six shrinking circles in total, with the first three shrinking every five minutes and the last three shrinking every ten minutes. The final circle is a 3 by 3 map size.\n1.6 If a score point is outside the shrinking circle, it will be erased and randomly added to an existing score point. For example, if a score point has 12 points and is erased, the 12 points will be randomly added to another existing score point. The final decision circle will accumulate all scores, earning 100 points per minute.\n1.7 If you are outside the shrinking circle, you will be randomly teleported to a coordinate inside the circle.\n1.8 Each Wanshan Array game will randomly choose one final decision circle from five options: \nCenter coordinate 50.50.\nSouthwest corner 2.2.\nNorthwest corner 2.98.\nSoutheast corner 98.2.\nNortheast corner 98.98.\n2. About Operation Jewelry:\n2.1 Move: Single finger swipe up, down, left, or right to move in four directions. The map directions are north (up), south (down), west (left), and east (right).\n2.2 View current coordinates: Single tap to view the current coordinates, double tap to view coordinates within a 3 by 3 area, checking for players, score points, and items. Swipe left or right to listen in detail, swipe up to attack the target if it is an item or transfer Six Soul Flag.\n2.3 Personal points and sect ranking: Long press to open personal points, sect ranking, and exit the battlefield. Swipe left or right to view and swipe up to confirm.\n2.4 Double-finger swipe right to view the array map in the hands of which player. View players marked by Six Soul Flags. View array map effect description.\n3. About Points:\n3.1 The ultimate goal is to gain more points; killing is not the goal.\n3.2 There are 10 score points in the battlefield, nine random and one fixed in the final decision circle center.\n3.3 Points are accumulated at a coordinate for one minute to earn points, with each score point having different points, completely random.\n3.4 Only the fixed score point in the final decision circle starts with 5 points per minute. It is advised not to rush to the final decision circle score point at the beginning, as the initial points are the lowest. Instead, find the random score points and move towards the final circle as the points accumulate.\n3.5 Killing a member of another sect awards points based on the combat power difference. The greater the difference, the fewer points awarded. For example, a 10 billion combat power team kills a 1 billion power team member, gaining 20 points. If both have 10 billion combat power, the winner gets 100 points. Generally, smaller power differences yield higher points.\n4. About Lives:\nEntering the Wanshan Array for the first time grants two lives. Being killed or erased by Six Soul Flags twice will exit the battlefield. After 10 minutes, you will revive and can re-enter. Subsequent deaths will exit the battlefield, with a 10-minute wait for revival.\n5. About Six Soul Flags:\n5.1 Six Soul Flags are randomly released during the Wanshan Array battle, a total of six times.\n5.2 The release rules vary, with two types: fixed-time explosion and cumulative-time explosion. Fixed-time means explosions after set times (e.g., 10, 12, 14 seconds). Cumulative-time means the time accumulates with transfers (e.g., one minute, two minutes). The exact time for cumulative-time explosions is not disclosed.\n5.3 If Six Soul Flags are present, no one can enter combat, except those already fighting.\n5.4 If a player marked by Six Soul Flags moves away, they will not be marked again. Moving out prevents further marking.\n5.5 Being erased by Six Soul Flags counts as losing a life.\n6. About Array Maps and Wanshan Spirits:\nArray maps enhance effects for sect members. Wanshan Spirits provide additional points and double attack bonuses. Below is the description of array map effects.\nArray Map Effect Description: Yellow River Array Map: After the holder’s sect defeats opponents, opponents' points will be halved. The effect disappears when the array map drops or is seized.\nExorcism Array Map: Excluding the holder, other sect members’ double attack increases by 50%. The effect disappears when the array map is seized.\nWanshan Array Map: Every two minutes of holding, surviving sect members get an additional 5 points. At the end of the sect competition, the holder's sect total points increase by 20%. The effect disappears when the array map is seized.\nWanshan Spirit: Each collected spirit grants 20 points and increases double attack percentage and fixed value, with incremental bonuses decreasing after each collection, up to five times. Defeat results in deduction of bonuses: one spirit lost on defeat, two to four spirits retain one bonus, five spirits retain two bonuses.",

Before registration, they need to consume 100 Fairystone to purchase the qualification to participate.\n2: The time period for purchasing the qualification is the last half-hour before the registration time and during the registration time. It cannot be purchased at any other time. When purchasing the qualification, the system will randomly select 25 heroes and divide them into 5 groups. Masters need to select one hero from each group, ultimately selecting five heroes to form their competitive deck for this round.\n3: After selecting the deck, Masters need to set the levels of the treasures and mounts for each hero. The initial level is 40, and Masters can freely distribute an additional 20 levels. Note that if a hero has multiple treasures, upgrading once will affect all of them.\n4: After setting the treasure and mount levels, Masters need to set the skill levels for the heroes. The default skill level for all heroes is 0, and Masters have 500 allocation points to distribute. Note that the allocation points are used across all heroes, and the minimum allocation per skill level is 10 points.\n5: After setting the skill levels, Masters also need to upgrade the quality of the heroes' treasures. The default quality is Posterior Heavenly Treasure, and Masters can upgrade a total of 12 levels. Note that if a hero has multiple treasures, upgrading once will affect all of them. Additionally, if Masters want to change the currently used treasure of a hero, they need to modify it in the hero's details section.\n5.1: After purchasing the qualification, Masters have 3 chances to reset their hero configurations. Each reset costs 50 Fairystone. VIP members at levels 5, 10, and 15 can each reset for free once. Reset attributes can be viewed in the hero's details section.\n5.2: If Masters are dissatisfied with the randomly selected deck, they can reset it through Destiny Reshaping. Note that resetting the deck costs 100 Fairystone. Masters below VIP level 4 can reset once per day, while those above VIP level 4 can reset twice.\n6: Matching Rules: The system starts a new match every 5 minutes. When the match starts, opponents are matched for all registered Masters. If the number of registrants is odd and greater than 10, the unmatched Master becomes the Lucky One and wins the match directly. If the number is less than 10, the match is considered a bye.\n6.1: After successful registration, if a Master goes offline before the match starts, their registration is canceled, and they need to re-register and match. If they go offline after the match starts, the system will automatically complete the match for them.\n7: Winning Rules: 1) Defeat all enemy heroes, 2) After the maximum number of rounds, the remaining health percentage of all surviving heroes on the Master's side is greater than that of the enemy.\n8: Reward Rules: 1) For each victory, Masters receive 30 Fairystone and 1 Destiny Point. 2) For cumulative victories of 3, 6, 9, and 12 matches, Masters receive additional Destiny Points of 3, 5, 7, and 10 respectively. 3) For consecutive victories from 2 to 10 matches, Masters receive additional Destiny Points ranging from 1 to 9. For more than 10 consecutive victories, the additional reward is also 9 Destiny Points. 4) If a Master wins 12 matches or loses 3 matches in a day, they cannot participate in the competition again on that day.\n9: Ranking Rules: The Destiny Arena has weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual rankings. Masters who rank in the top 10 in any of these categories receive significant rebate rewards. The specific reward amounts can be viewed in the relevant reward details.",

Note: Before selecting, the position of each hero must be arranged; \nAfter the selection is complete, team members need to assign mounts, artifact levels, skill levels, and artifact skill levels to their heroes. The process is the same as the single-player Destiny gameplay, and the skill points are also the same. The difference is that each member can only arrange the hero they have chosen. It is recommended that the team discusses and reaches a consensus on how many points to allocate to each hero; \nNote: The maximum time for rock-paper-scissors is 10 seconds. If the time limit is exceeded, a random choice will be made. The maximum time for hero selection is 30 seconds. If the time limit is exceeded, a random choice will be made. Note 2: The chosen heroes and their positions can be seen by all opposing team members; \nAfter entering the battle, it is the same as the Destiny Arena, with the only difference being that team members can only control the artifact skills of the heroes they have chosen.",

    "子牙听罢，心下疑惑，乃同哪吒、杨戬等都上城来观看，闻太师行营今番大不相同。": "After hearing this, Ziya was puzzled and went up to the city with Nezha, Yang Jian, and others to watch. He heard that the Taishi's camp was very different today.",
    "子牙听言甚喜，遂传令：\"摘了'免战牌'。\"": "Ziya was delighted to hear this and sent the order, \"Take off the 'exemption card'",
    "子牙听说，忙请武王并辔上前。只见伯夷、叔齐向前稽首曰：\"千岁与子牙公，见礼了。\"": "Ziya heard about it and quickly invited King Wu to come forward with a reins. I saw Boyi and Shuqi inspecting the head and saying, \"Greetings, Qiansui and Ziya Gong",
    "子牙听陆压一番言语，也无主张，故此子牙复传令：\"叫大小三军，依旧扎住营寨。\"": "Upon hearing Lu's words, Ziya had no objections. Therefore, Ziya issued the order again: \"Call on the three armies, big and small, to still hold the camp",
    "子牙命哪吒出城。哪吒登风火轮来至阵前，只管瞧，不见将官，只管往营里看。土行孙其身只高四尺有馀，哪吒不曾往下看。": "Ziya ordered Nezha to leave the city. Nezha climbed onto the Wind and Fire Wheel and arrived at the front of the formation. He only looked around and didn't see any generals, so he just looked into the camp. Tu Xingsun was only about four feet tall, and Nezha never looked down.",
    "子牙在中军忽听得劫营，急自上骑，左右门人俱来中军护卫。只见黑云密布，风火交加，刀刃齐下，如山崩地裂之势，灯烛难支。三千火车兵冲 我进辕门，如潮奔浪滚，如何抵挡。冲且黑夜，彼此不能相顾，只杀得血流成渠，尸骸遍野，哪分别人自己。": "Ziya suddenly heard about the looting of the camp in the central army, and quickly got on horseback. Both the left and right disciples came to the central army for protection. I saw black clouds densely covering the ground, with wind and fire mixed together. The blades were all at the same level, like mountains collapsing and the ground splitting, making it difficult to support the lamps and candles. Three thousand train soldiers rushed towards me through the gate, rolling like waves, how to resist. Rushing into the dark night, unable to care for each other, only killing until blood flowed and corpses were scattered everywhere, no one else's own.",
    "子牙在中军正坐，有先行官哪吒进前言曰：\"兵至关下，宜当速战。师叔驻兵不战，何也？\"": "Ziya was sitting in the middle of the army when the vanguard officer Nezha came forward and said, \"The troops are crucial, so it's better to fight quickly. What's the point of not fighting when my master is stationed",
    "子牙在岐山，二箭射右目，三箭劈心一箭，三箭射了草人。公明死于成汤营里。": "Ziya is in Qishan. Two arrows hit the right eye, three arrows hit the heart with one arrow, and three arrows hit the scarecrow. Gongming died in Chengtang Camp.",
    "子牙在府内只听的百姓呐喊之声，振动华岳。燃灯已知道了，与广成子出静室看火。": "The cries of the people that Ziya only heard in the mansion shook Mount Hua. I already know how to light the lamp. Let's go out of the quiet room with Guangchengzi to watch the fire.",
    "子牙在相府自因得胜，与众将逐日议论天下大事，忽听喊声，子牙曰：\"闻太师想必取得援兵至矣。\"": "Ziya was in the prime minister's mansion discussing major world affairs with the generals day by day because of his victory. Suddenly, he heard a shout and said, \"I heard that the Grand Tutor must have received reinforcements",
    "子牙坐四不相平空去了，金、木二吒土遁逃回，哪吒风火轮走了，龙须虎藉水里逃生。众将无术，焉能得脱。": "Ziya sat in a disheveled position and left, while Jin and Mu fled back to Earth. Nezha's Wind and Fire Wheel left, and the Dragon Bearded Tiger escaped through the water. The generals are powerless, how can they escape.",
    "子牙坐四不相，走出阵前。见对面一道者，生的形容古怪，尖嘴缩腮，头挽双髻，徐徐而来。怎见得，有赞为证：": "Ziya sat in a state of confusion and walked out of the formation. Seeing the person on the other side, he described it strangely, with a pointed mouth and pursed cheeks, his head tied in a bun, and slowly approaching. How can I see, there are likes as evidence:",
    "子牙坐在银安殿，正与众将议事，忽报：\"成汤营有一女将讨战。\"": "Ziya was sitting in the Yin'an Hall, discussing with the generals, when she suddenly reported, \"There is a female general from Chengtang Camp fighting",
    "子牙大喜，命左右：\"排队伍出城，迎接邓元帅。\"左右闻命，俱披执迎接里馀之地，已见邓九公军卒来至。": "Ziya was overjoyed and ordered, \"Line up and go out of the city to welcome Marshal Deng.\" Upon hearing the order, both sides donned their robes to welcome the soldiers of Deng Jiugong in the remaining areas.",
    "子牙大喜，见杨戬超群出类。杨戬与诸门人会了，见过武王，复来问：\"城外屯兵者何人？\"": "Ziya was overjoyed to see Yang Jian stand out from the crowd. Yang Jian met with various disciples, met with King Wu, and asked again, \"Who is the one stationed outside the city",
    "子牙大喜：\"将军有子出家修道，更当庆幸！\"": "Ziya was overjoyed and said, \"General, it's even more fortunate that you have a son who has become a monk",
    "子牙左右将士欲行，见伯夷、叔齐二人言之不已，心上甚是不快。": "The soldiers on both sides of Ziya were about to leave, but when they saw Boyi and Shuqi talking incessantly, they felt very unhappy.",
    "子牙径往迎接，上篷坐下。内有广成子曰：\"众位道友，今日前来，兴废可知，真假自辨。子牙公几时破十绝阵？吾等听从指教。\"": "Ziya went straight to greet and sat down under the canopy. Confucius Guangcheng said, \"Fellow Taoists, come here today and you will know whether it is true or false. When will Duke Ziya break through the Ten Absolute Formation? We will listen to your guidance",
    "子牙忙出迎接，二人携手至帐中坐下。": "Ziya hurriedly went out to greet him, and the two of them sat down hand in hand in the tent.",
    "子牙忙勒骑向前，携九公手，并辔而言曰：\"今将军既知顺逆，弃暗投明，俱是一殿之臣，何得又分彼此。况令爱又归吾门下师侄，吾又何敢赚将军哉。\"": "Ziya hurriedly rode forward, holding nine hands and a reins, and said, \"Now that the general knows both the right and wrong, and abandons the dark and turns to the bright, they are all ministers of the same palace. How can we divide each other? Kuang Ling'ai belongs to my nephew, how dare I win the general's favor",
    "子牙急展聚仙旗。──此乃瑶池之宝，只见氤氲遍地，一派异香，笼罩上面，番天印不得下来。": "Ziya urgently displays the Juxian Banner. This is the treasure of the Yao Pool. It is shrouded in mist and a strange fragrance that cannot be imprinted by the heavens.",
    "子牙急睁眼看时，又被彩云仙子一戮目珠打伤眼目，几乎落骑。琼霄发剑冲杀，幸得杨戬前后救护，方保无虞。": "When Ziya urgently opened her eyes to look, she was hit in the eye by Fairy Caiyun's eye drop, almost falling off her horse. Qiongxiao brandished his sword and charged forward, fortunately receiving rescue from Yang Jian in front and behind, ensuring no safety.",
    "子牙惊曰：\"兵困城事小，城中缺粮事大。如之奈何！\"": "Ziya exclaimed, \"The military siege in the city is a small matter, but the shortage of food in the city is a big problem. What can we do",
    "子牙把四不相催至军前见法戒，曰：\"道者请了！\"": "Ziya urged Si Bu Xiang to the front of the army to meet Fa Jie and said, \"Please, Taoist",
    "子牙把打神鞭祭起，正中云霄，掉下青鸾。有碧霄急来救时，杨戬又放起哮天犬，把碧霄肩膀上一口，连皮带服扯了一块下来。菡芝仙见势不好，把风袋打开放出黑风。": "Ziya raised the whip and offered it as a sacrifice, hitting the clouds and falling into the blue phoenix. When Bixiao came to rescue him urgently, Yang Jian let go of the howling heavenly dog and took a bite off Bixiao's shoulder, pulling off a piece of her belt and clothing. Hanzhi Xian saw that the situation was not good and opened the wind bag to release black wind.",
    "子牙把魔家四将用的\"地、水、火、风\"物件说了一遍，\"……故此挂'免战牌'。\"": "Ziya repeated the objects of \"earth, water, fire, and wind\" used by the four generals of the demon family, \"Therefore, hang the 'exemption card'",
    "子牙方欲回兵，军政官报入：\"启元帅：有陆压道人在辕门外来见。\"": "Ziya Fang wanted to return to the army, and the military and political officials reported, \"Marshal Qi: There is a Taoist who is pressing the land outside the gate",
    "子牙暗思：\"大王之言虽是，老臣恐违天命。\"武王曰：\"天命有在，何必强为！岂有凡事阻逆之理？\"": "Ziya thought to himself, \"Although the words of the king are true, I am afraid that I will violate the mandate of heaven.\" King Wu said, \"The mandate of heaven is there, why force it! Is there any reason to oppose everything",
    "子牙曰：\"不可。吾如今三路分兵：一路取佳梦关；一路取青龙关；佥二位总兵以取二关，非才德兼全、英雄一世者不足以当此任。吾知非黄将军、洪将军不可。\"": "Ziya said, \"No. Currently, I have three divisions of troops: one at Jiameng Pass, the other at Qinglong Pass, and two generals to take two passes. Those who are not talented and virtuous, and have been heroes for a lifetime, are not enough to hold this position. I know it is not possible without General Huang and General Hong",
    "子牙曰：\"不可。吾若出示，民慌军乱，必有内变之祸。料还有十日之粮，再作区处。\"": "Ziya said, \"No. If I show it, the people will panic and the army will be in chaos, and there will be a disaster of internal turmoil. There is still ten days' worth of food left, and it will be used for the district",
    "子牙曰：\"元帅请了！\"": "Ziya said, \"Marshal, please",
    "子牙曰：\"后有追兵，用的是万刃车，又有风火助威，势不可当。此是左道异术，你仔细且避其锐。\"": "Ziya said, \"There are pursuers behind us, using ten thousand blade carts and wind and fire to support them. Their momentum is unstoppable. This is a unique technique in the left lane, so be careful and avoid its sharpness",
    "子牙曰：\"哪里来的？\"道人曰：\"弟子乃玉泉山金霞洞玉鼎真人门下，姓杨，名戬；奉师命，特来师叔左右听用。\"": "Ziya said, \"Where did you come from?\" The Taoist replied, \"I am a disciple of the real person of Yuding in Jinxia Cave, Yuquan Mountain. My surname is Yang and my name is Jian. I have been ordered by my teacher to come to my master's side and listen to him",
    "子牙曰：\"天命无常，惟有德者居之。昔帝尧有子丹朱不萧，让位与舜。舜帝有子商均亦不肖，让位与禹。禹有子启贤，能继父志，禹尊禅让，复让与益。天下之朝觐讼狱，不之益而之启。再后传之桀。桀王无道，成汤伐夏而有天下。今传之纣。纣王今淫酗肆虐，秽德彰闻，天怒民怨，四海鼎沸。德在我周，恭行天之罚。将军何不顺天以归我周，共罚独夫也？\"": "Ziya said, \"The mandate of heaven is impermanent, only those with virtue reside there. In the past, Emperor Yao had a son named Danzhu who did not slack off and abdicated in favor of Shun. Emperor Shun had a son named Shangjun who also did not slack off and abdicated in favor of Yu. Yu had a son named Qixian who was able to follow in his father's footsteps, and Yu respected abdication and abdicated in favor of others. The pilgrimage and litigation of the world were initiated without benefit. Later, it was passed down as Jie. King Jie was unrighteous and became the ruler of the Xia Dynasty. Today, it is passed down as Zhou. King Zhou is now plagued by debauchery and drunkenness, and his impure virtue is widely known. Heaven is angry and the people are resentful, and the four seas are boiling. Virtue is in our Zhou, and he respectfully punishes Heaven. Why not follow Heaven Is it okay to punish my only husband together",
    "子牙曰：\"将军何以知之？\"黄飞虎答曰：\"此四将昔日在末将麾下，征伐东海，故此晓得。今对丞相，不得不以实告。\"子牙听罢，郁郁不乐。": "Ziya said, \"How did the general know?\" Huang Feihu replied, \"These four generals were under the command of the last general to conquer the East China Sea in the past, so I know. Now, I have to tell the Prime Minister the truth.\" Ziya listened and felt unhappy.",
    "子牙曰：\"当时吾在朝歌，不曾会闻太师；今日领兵到此，看他纪法何如。\"遂带诸将上城，众门下相随，同到城敌楼上，观看闻太师行营；果然好人马！怎见得，有赞为证：": "Ziya said, \"At that time, I was singing in court and had never heard of the Grand Preceptor. Today, I am leading my troops here to see how well his discipline and laws are.\" He then led his generals to the city, and all the gates followed him to the enemy tower to watch the Grand Preceptor's camp; Truly a good horse! How can I see, there are likes as evidence:",
    "子牙曰：\"有这样事？\"杨戬曰：\"他前日拿师叔，据弟子看，定是捆仙绳。今日弟子被他捆著，我留心著意，仔细定睛，还是捆仙绳，分毫不差。待弟子往夹龙山飞龙洞去探问一番，何如？\"": "Ziya said, \"Is there such a thing?\" Yang Jian said, \"The other day he took his master's uncle, and according to my disciple's opinion, it must have been tied up with a fairy rope. Today, my disciple was tied up with him, and I paid close attention to it. Whether it was tied up with a fairy rope or not, there was no difference. When my disciple went to Feilong Cave in Jialong Mountain to inquire, what would it be like",
    "子牙曰：\"来将何名？\"": "Ziya said, \"What name will you give me",
    "子牙曰：\"杨戬催粮去了，不在行营。道者，你既在蓬莱岛，难道不知天意。今成汤传位六百馀年，至纣王无道，暴弃天命，肆行歔恶，罪恶贯盈，天怒人怨，天下叛之。我周应天顺人，克修天道，天下归周。今奉天之罚，以观政于商，尔何得阻逆天吏，自取灭亡哉！道者，你不观余化诸人皆是此例，他纵有道术，岂能扭转天命耶！\"": "Ziya said, \"Yang Jian has gone to collect grain and is no longer in the camp. As a Taoist, since you are on Penglai Island, do you not know the will of heaven? Today, after more than 600 years of Tang's reign, King Zhou has been disobedient, disobedient to the mandate of heaven, and committed heinous crimes. Heaven is angry and people are resentful, and the whole world has rebelled against him. I, Zhou, should obey the will of heaven, cultivate the way of heaven, and the whole world will return to Zhou. Now that I am serving the punishment of heaven, how can I obstruct the rebellious officials and bring about self destruction! As a Taoist, if you do not observe the transformation of all people, how can he reverse the mandate of heaven? Even if he has Taoist skills, how can he",
    "子牙曰：\"此虑甚远，且防他目下进城。\"杨戬亦不敢再说。": "Ziya said, \"This is a far sighted concern, and we need to prevent him from entering the city.\" Yang Jian also dared not say any more.",
    "子牙曰：\"然也。\"孔宣问曰：\"你原是殷臣，为何造反，妄自称王，会合诸侯，逆天欺心，不守本土？吾今奉诏征讨，汝好好退兵，敬守臣节，可保家国；若半字迟延，吾定削平西土，那时悔之晚矣。\"": "Ziya said, \"Of course.\" Kong Xuan asked, \"You were originally a minister of Yin. Why did you rebel, proclaim yourself king, gather with the lords, betray the heavens and deceive your heart, and not defend your homeland? I am now ordered to launch a campaign, so please withdraw your troops, respect the loyalty of your retainers, and protect your family and country. If you delay in writing, I will surely level up the western territories. It will be too late to regret then",
    "子牙曰：\"用兵有三忌：道人，陀头，妇女。此三等人非是左道，定有邪术。彼仗邪术，恐将士不提防，误被所伤，深为厉害。\"": "Ziya said, \"There are three taboos when using military force: Taoists, Tuotou, and women. These three people are not from the Left Way and must have evil skills. If they use evil skills, they may be afraid that their soldiers will not be on guard and will be injured by mistake, which will be very severe",
    "子牙曰：\"纣王无道，逆命于天，残虐万姓，囚奴正士，焚炙忠良，荒淫不道，无辜吁天，秽德彰闻。惟我先王，若日月之照临，光于四方，显于西土，命我先王肃将天威，大勋未集。惟我西周诞及多方，肆予小子，恭行天之罚。今天下诸侯一德一心，大会于孟津，我武维扬，侵于之疆，取彼凶残，杀伐用张，于汤有光。此予小子不得已之心也。\"": "Ziya said, \"King Zhou is unrighteous, disobeying orders from heaven, torturing ten thousand surnames, imprisoning slaves and righteous scholars, burning loyal and righteous people, indulging in debauchery and immorality, innocently calling out to heaven, and displaying his impure virtues. But I, the former king, am like the sun and moon shining in all directions, and have not yet gathered great honors. But I, the Western Zhou Dynasty, have been born in many ways, and I have been giving my son the punishment of heaven. Today, all the princes are united in virtue and one heart, and I have gathered in Mengjin. I, Wu Weiyang, have invaded the territory, taken them cruelly, killed and used Zhang, and brought light to Tang. This is a last resort for my son",
    "子牙曰：\"虽是如此，民不安生，军逢恶战，将累鞍马，俱不是宁泰之象。\"": "Ziya said, \"Even so, the people are restless. The army will tire the Pommeled Horse in the fierce battle, which is not the image of peace and tranquility.\"",
    "子牙曰：\"道兄今到此，有何事见谕？\"": "Ziya said, \"Brother Dao is here now. What advice do you have",
    "子牙曰：\"道者姓甚名谁？\"": "Ziya said, \"What is the surname and name of the Taoist",
    "子牙曰：\"邓将军回营，多拜上闻太师，原书批回，三日后会兵城下。\"": "Ziya said, \"General Deng, return to the camp and pay more respects to the Shangwen Grand Tutor. The original book approves the return, and we will meet at the foot of the military city in three days",
    "子牙曰：\"首次出军，当宜小心。\"": "Ziya said, \"When you go out of the army for the first time, you should be careful",
    "子牙曰：\"魔家四将乃左道之术也，须紧要提防。\"": "Ziya said, \"The four generals of the demon family are the techniques of the Left Way, and we must be vigilant",
    "子牙曰：“尚该如此，理当受之。”": "Ziya said, \"It should be done this way, and we should accept it",
    "子牙曰：“道友高姓何名？今日会尚有何事吩付？”": "Ziya said, \"What is the name of Daoist friend Gao? What other instructions will we have today",

Kong Xuan saw Ziya coming and picked up his horse to approach the army, asking, \"Is it Jiang Ziya who came here",
    "子牙看罢，惊讶不已。诸弟子默默不言，只得下城入府，共议破敌，实是无策。": "Ziya was amazed after reading it. The disciples remained silent and had no choice but to go down to the city and enter the mansion to discuss and defeat the enemy, but there was no solution.",
    "子牙笑曰：\"将军之言差矣。君正，则居其位；君不正，则求为匹夫不可得。是天命岂有常哉，惟有德者能君之。昔夏桀暴虐，成汤伐之，代夏而有天下。今纣王罪过于桀，天下诸侯叛之。我周特奉天之罚，以讨有罪，安敢有逆天命，厥罪惟钧哉。\"": "Ziya smiled and said, \"The words of the general are wrong. If you are upright, you will occupy your position; if you are not upright, you will seek to become a commoner, which cannot be obtained. It is the mandate of heaven that cannot be fulfilled, only those with virtue can govern. In the past, Xia Jie was cruel and tyrannical, and he was defeated by the Tang Dynasty. Now, King Zhou has committed a heinous crime, and all the lords in the world have rebelled against him. I, Zhou, have been punished by heaven to punish those who are guilty. I dare to go against the mandate of heaven, and my guilt is only great",

The world belongs to the Lord of Zhou, and all the wise men have rebelled against their husbands. I don't expect you to be just a river of water. What can you do to help? Today, the eight hundred lords have launched a campaign against Wudao, and I will soon join forces with Mengjin to punish the people and save them from suffering and quell the chaos. If you surrender in a hurry, you will return to the right path and not lose your title as a marquis. If you dare to go against heaven and help Wudao, you will be self inflicted and cruel",
    "子牙答曰：\"道友，不才便是。道友，你既在道门，便知天命。今纣恶贯盈，天人共怒，天下诸侯，大会孟津，观政于商，你何得助纣为虐，逆天行事，独不思得罪于天耶！况吾非一己之私，奉玉虚符命，以恭行天之罚，道友又何必逆天强为之哉。不若听吾之言，倒戈纳降，吾亦体上天好生之仁，决不肯糜烂其民也。\"": "Ziya replied, \"Dao friend, if you are not talented, then you are. Dao friend, since you are in the Dao gate, you already know the will of heaven. Now that Zhou's evil is rampant and heaven and man are angry together, the feudal lords of the world are gathered in Mengjin and observing politics in Shang. How can you help Zhou to commit tyranny and act against heaven without offending heaven? I am not one of my own selfish interests. I have been ordered by the Jade Void Talisman to perform the punishment of heaven with respect. Why should Dao friend act against heaven and be strong? If you do not listen to my words and turn against heaven and surrender, I will also embody the goodness of heaven and refuse to corrupt its people",

Where is the Immortal Mansion? Today, Xiqi has repeatedly defeated our sect. What did Dao Brother see and do? Today, Lord Zhou has no way, and the Zhou family has shown benevolence, which is common in the world. Since people have always submitted to Allah, why should Dao Brother act forcefully? As the saying goes, 'Those who submit to Heaven will survive, and those who go against Heaven will perish.' Today, I am Zhou Fengming on Qishan, and heroes have emerged. It seems that I do not know. How can Dao Brother go against Heaven and do his own thing?

If you don't listen, then you will submit a memorial: In ancient times, women were paired with husbands, and it wasn't just about social status. Today, Tu Xingsun is not an unknown young person. He was originally a senior brother under the Sun family who was afraid of leaving him in Feilong Cave on Jialong Mountain. Because there was a gap between Shen Gongbao and Jiang Ziya, it was said that Tu Xingsun went down the mountain to help Marshal conquer Xiqi. Yesterday, his master went down the mountain and captured Xing Sun in the city because he was poor in his work. Although he was misled by Shen Gongbao, he promised love to the Marshal and had this marriage, he secretly went to Qicheng to assassinate him because he was deeply in love with the Marshal. He wanted to succeed quickly, which was a good idea. Yesterday he was captured, and Fugu was not in vain. However, he repeatedly begged Prime Minister Jiang and his master to be afraid of leaving his grandson and said, 'For this marriage, I will not close my eyes in death.' Both Prime Minister Jiang and his master refused to forgive him and only comforted him on the side: how could his momentary mistake ruin the good things in the world! I advised Prime Minister Jiang to temporarily stay. Yisheng spared no effort and paid a special tribute to the Marshal, begging for good deeds to be bestowed upon humanity. He expressed his gratitude to his children, which is also the heart of the Marshal's parents in heaven and earth. Therefore, Yisheng did not shy away from axes and swords, and especially respected his appearance in order to seek guidance. If this happens to the Marshal, Prime Minister Jiang will still send Tu Xingsun back to the Marshal to establish a marriage relationship, and then determine the gender. He didn't say anything. \"",

A great man's words are already spoken, and it is difficult to chase them back. Moreover, when it comes to marriage and personal relationships, how can it be discussed as a child's play? The Marshal's words a day ago were believed by the descendants of the local people; the descendants of the local people were also believed by the whole world; it was passed down to both China and foreign countries, and everyone believed in it. As the saying goes, 'The mouths of the people on the road are like a monument.' We will think that the Marshal is a perfect match for a woman, but who believes in Marshal's expedient skills, and we will have to do this for the country. We will only use the body of our beloved daughter as a topic of conversation, and the beautiful ladies in our boudoir will talk about it. If we don't fully understand this matter, it will only make our I cherish it for the Marshal! Now the Marshal is the Minister of Tang, and every in the world who is three feet tall has been ordered. If this happens, I don't know what taxes will be imposed. I beg the Marshal to dismiss me",
    "散宜生笑曰：\"吾与公既为敌国，安敢造次请见。只有一件大事，特来请一明示，无他耳。昨因拿有一将，系是元帅门婿；於盘问中，道及斯意。吾丞相不忍骤加极刑，以割人间恩爱，故命宜生亲至辕门，特请尊裁。\"": "San Yisheng smiled and said, \"Since our country is an enemy, I dare to make a second visit. There is only one important matter, and I have come to make it clear that I have no other ears. Yesterday, I received a general who is the son-in-law of a marshal.

    "殷郊曰：“我不曾奉旨而来。待吾修本，先往朝歌，求援兵来至，料此一城有何难破？”": "Yin Jiao said, \"I did not come by decree. After I have finished my studies, I will first go to Chaoge and ask for reinforcements to come. I wonder why this city is difficult to break through",
    "殷郊曰：“申公豹之言固不可信；吾弟之死，又是天数，终不然是吾弟自走入太极图中去，寻此惨酷极刑。老师说得好笑！”": "Yin Jiao said, \"The words of Shen Gongbao cannot be trusted; the death of my younger brother was another matter of fate, otherwise it was my younger brother who walked into the Taiji diagram and sought this cruel and extreme punishment. The teacher laughed",
    "殷郊欠身，口称：“师叔，弟子今日回朝歌，老师为何阻吾去路？”": "Yin Jiao bowed and said, \"Master, I'm going back to court today. Why is the teacher blocking my way",
    "殷郊泣诉曰：“老师在上，听弟子所陈：弟子领命下山，又收了温良、马善；中途遇着申公豹，说弟子保纣伐周。弟子岂肯有负师言。弟子知吾父残虐不仁，肆行无道，固得罪于天下，弟子不敢有违天命；只吾幼弟又得何罪，竟将太极图把他化作飞灰，他与你何仇，遭此惨死！此岂有仁心者所为，此岂以德行仁之主！言之痛心刺骨！老师反欲我事仇，是诚何心！”殷郊言罢，放声大哭。": "Yin Jiao wept and said, \"Teacher, I heard from my disciple that he had been ordered down the mountain and had taken in Wen Liang and Ma Shan. Along the way, I encountered Shen Gongbao and accused him of protecting Zhou and attacking Zhou. How could I betray my teacher's words? I know that my father is cruel, cruel, and immoral, and has offended the world. I dare not violate the will of heaven. But what crime did my younger brother suffer? He turned the Taiji diagram into ashes. What enmity did he have with you? What tragic death did he suffer from? How could a benevolent person do such a thing? How could he be the ruler of virtue and benevolence! His words are heart wrenching and bone chilling! The teacher's desire for revenge is sincere!\" Yin Jiao finished speaking. Cry loudly.",
    "殷郊自思：“昨日吾师出城见我，未曾取胜；今日令子牙单骑出城要马善，必有缘故。且令马善出战，看是如何。”": "Yin Jiao thought to himself, \"Yesterday my teacher went out of the city to see me, but we did not win. Today, I have ordered my son Ya to ride alone out of the city and ask for a good horse. Let me also ask for a good horse to go to war and see what happens",
    "殷郊见燃灯展开杏黄旗，就有万朵金莲现出，番天印不得下来，恐被他人收去了，忙收印在手。忽然望见正西上一看，见子牙在龙凤幡下。": "Yin Jiao saw the burning of lanterns and the unfolding of apricot yellow flags, and ten thousand golden lotus flowers appeared. Fan Tian couldn't stamp them down, fearing that they might be taken away by others, so he quickly collected them and printed them in his hands. Suddenly, I looked up to the west and saw Ziya under the dragon and phoenix flags.",
    "殷郊还不曾睡，只听得杀声大振，忙出帐，上马拎戟，掌起灯笼火把。灯光内只见黄家父子杀进辕门。": "Yin Jiao had not slept yet, only hearing the sound of killing loudly. He hurriedly went out of his tent, mounted his horse, grabbed his halberd, and held up his lantern and torch. In the light, the father and son of the Huang family rushed into the gate.",

Incomplete textured stones have a lower success rate, while regular textured stones have a higher success rate and are also more difficult to obtain than incomplete textured stones.; When there is no need to protect props for reinforcement, once the reinforcement fails, the reinforcement level will be reset to zero. The first 20 levels cannot use protective props.; When the rune is strengthened to between level 20 and level 29, the controller can use Star Soul Spirit to protect equipment that fails to strengthen and only drops levels 0 to 1.; When the rune is strengthened to between level 30 and level 39, the controller can use Star Soul Crystals to protect equipment that fails to strengthen and only drops levels 1 to 2.; When the rune is strengthened to between level 40 and level 50, the controller can use Star Soul Spirit and Star Soul Crystals to protect equipment. If the strengthening fails, only level 1 to 2 will be dropped, or a certain amount of same part essence will be consumed without dropping level.; When the rune is strengthened to level 50 and there are no less than 20 attributes of the same type, Holy Text Enhancement can be activated to strengthen the Holy Text level using Rule Scars.; When the Holy Text Protection Prop is no longer used for reinforcement, if the reinforcement of Holy Text level 10 or above fails, the Holy Text level will be reset to zero. Failure will result in the corresponding level of incomplete Holy Text Blessing Rules. A certain number of incomplete Holy Text Blessing Rules can be synthesized into Holy Text Blessing Rules, and the reinforcement of Blessing Rules will be successful.; The protection props cannot be used in the first 6 levels of the Holy Scripture level, and cannot be dropped in case of failure.; Holy text levels 7 to 9 cannot use protective items, and if it fails, it drops to level 6.; When the Holy Scripture level is strengthened from level 9 to level 10, protective items cannot be used, and the Holy Scripture level will be reset to zero if it fails.; Attention: If the controller is not satisfied with the attribute that has been enhanced, they can use Void Paths to clear the attribute. It should be noted that if the attribute has been attached multiple times, it will drop the corresponding level after clearing, which means it cannot be cleared level by level. In addition, it is recommended to wait until the enhancement reaches level 30 before considering clearing.; The specific attributes that can be attached are as follows:; Sun Moon Star Enhancement Additional Attributes:; Physical attack technique skill=100000; Speed=4000; The speed bonus of the physical attack technique is 0.1 to 1.5; The speed percentage of physical attack technique is between 9% and 15%; The attributes that can be attached to the enhancement of Chen Yin Yang:; Physical and legal defense=50000 yuan; Life=600000; Physical Attack Method Skill Bonus=0.1 to 1.5 Life Bonus=0.4 to 2; The percentage of physical attack skill is between 9% and 15%; Life=11% to 25%; Attention: The attribute bonus refers to the halo bonus, and the percentage bonus refers to the immortal gate bonus.;",

I saw all the Taoist priests: wearing one character scarves, nine Yang scarves, fish tail golden crowns, blue jade crowns, wearing double buns, or wearing Tuo Tou costumes, all chatting leisurely in front of the hillside, not in one place.",

How can you say that I am in a difficult situation and use this to deceive me? Are you and I using the technique of the Five Elements to inform me? You are playing with me like this now, let's see what kind of rule you have over me",

He was so angry that the three corpse gods were irritable, and smoke was rising from his seven orifices. I think to myself, \"Alright! Now that the two southeastern regions have gradually been pacified, I will face you tomorrow and must personally launch an attack in order to defeat the enemy",
    "闻太师悲咽泣诉，泪雨如珠，曰：\"道兄赵公明不幸遭萧升、曹宝收了定海珠去。他往道友洞府借了金蛟剪来，就会燃灯；交战时便祭此剪。燃灯逃遁，其坐下一鹿闸为两段。次日有一野人陆压会令兄，又祭此剪，陆压化作长虹而走。然后两下不曾会战。数日来，西岐山姜尚立坛行术，咒诅令兄，被吾算出。彼时令兄有二门人——陈九公、姚少司，令他去抢钉头七箭书，又被哪吒杀死。令兄对吾说：'悔不听吾妹云霄之言，果有今日之苦。'他将金蛟剪用道服包定，留与三位道友，见服如见公明。\"": "Upon hearing the sorrowful and tearful words of the Grand Preceptor, tears streamed down his face as if they were pearls. He said, \"Unfortunately, Brother Zhao Gongming was taken away by Xiao Sheng and Cao Bao for the Dinghai Pearl. He borrowed a golden dragon cutter from his Taoist friend's cave and would light a lamp. During the battle, he would offer this cutter as a sacrifice. When the lamp was lit, he fled and sat down at a deer gate in two sections. The next day, a wild man named Lu Ya met with his elder brother and offered this cutter again. Lu Ya turned into a rainbow and left. However, there was no battle between them. For a few days, Jiang Shang from West Qishan set up an altar to perform magic and cursed his elder brother, which I calculated. At that time, his elder brother had two disciples - Chen Jiugong and Yao Shaosi - and ordered him to snatch nails. The first seven arrows were written, and he was killed by Nezha. My elder brother said to me, 'I regret not listening to my sister Yunxiao's words. If I had suffered today, I would have suffered.' He wrapped the Golden Dragon Scissors in Taoist robes and left them with three Taoist friends. Seeing the robes was like seeing public light",

Your Taoist skills are only like this! I won't be staying here soon, I'll go!\" He ascended one level and drove away, ready to leave.",

    "闻太师正战之间，忽见火起，心中大惊，自思：\"粮草被烧，大营难立。\"把金鞭架枪、挡剑，无心恋战。": "During the midst of the Taishi's battle, he suddenly saw a fire and was greatly surprised. He thought to himself, \"Grain and forage have been burned, and it's difficult to establish a large camp.\" He put on his golden whip, mounted his spear, and blocked his sword, without any desire to fight.",

Under the banner of the banner, Ziya rode on four different horses, and under his right hand, King Wucheng Huang Feihu rode out on a five colored divine ox. I only saw the Grand Tutor standing under the Dragon and Phoenix Banners, with four generals on either side: Deng, Xin, Zhang, and Tao. The Grand Master's face was as pale as gold, with five willows and a long beard, fluttering behind his head, and holding a golden whip in his hand. How can we see the mighty power of Master Wen",
    "闻太师看见，大呼曰：\"列位道友，好自在也！\"众道人回头，见是闻太师，俱起身相迎。内有秦天君曰：\"闻得道兄征伐西岐，前日申公豹在此相邀助你，吾等在此练十阵图，方得完备。适道兄到临，真是万千之幸！\"": "Upon seeing this, Venerable Wen exclaimed, \"Fellow Taoists, you are so at ease!\" The Taoist turned around and saw that it was Venerable Wen. They all stood up to greet him. Qin Tianjun said, \"I heard that Brother Dao has launched an attack on Xiqi. The other day, Shen Gongbao invited me here to help you.

However, seeing the steep terrain, he was deeply puzzled. Looking up suddenly, I saw a person wearing a water hydrate Taoist robe, who recognized the Cloud Neutron in Zhongnan Mountain Yuzhu Cave.

Deng, Xin, Zhang, and Tao, the four generals, were trembling with fear. \"With such a high master in the Zhou camp, how can we confront him?\" The camp was only disturbed by the death of Gong Ming, and their troops were disorganized.",
    "闻太师道罢，放声掩面大哭。五位道姑齐动悲声。太师起身，忙取袍服所包金蛟剪放于案上。三位娘娘展开，睹物伤情，泪不能干。": "Upon hearing the words of the Grand Master, he burst into tears and covered his face. The five Taoist nuns let out a mournful cry together. The Grand Tutor stood up and quickly took the golden dragon scissors wrapped in his robe and placed them on the table. The three empresses unfolded, seeing the wounds and tears that could not be dried.",

These words must not be heard from outsiders, as they only tarnish my father's reputation throughout his life. My father has received high status and wealth from the country, with purple clothes, waist and gold, and a wife and children. Everything is a sign of kindness. Today, the Lord places great importance on my father. My father did not want to repay the country's kindness, sacrificed his life to be chaste, and instead followed the plans of his children and women. He was greedy for life and afraid of death, leaving behind ridicule for future generations. Such behavior is not worthy of the court's reliance on him as a minister. As the ancient saying goes, 'Those who are in the country will die in the country, and those who are in the frontier will die in the frontier.' My father should not be lightly dismissed. The two brothers of the were once taught by their family and learned archery and horsemanship at a young age. When they encountered strangers, they were quite skilled in various techniques and had not yet mastered them. They had been practicing on their own for a few days and finished today. They intended to advance, but did not expect their father to abandon the pass. The is willing to serve his country to the death",

The profit of cannibalism should be divided into people's worries. If it's all done by oneself, then what's the use of the court to raise soldiers?
